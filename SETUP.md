# Email Processing Setup

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your environment variables:

1. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - Your OpenAI API key for email categorization
   - Get it from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Format: `sk-...`

2. **NEXTAUTH_URL** - Your application URL
   - For development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - For production: Your actual domain

## Gmail API Setup

The app uses the existing Google OAuth setup, but make sure your Google Cloud Console project has:

1. Gmail API enabled
2. Appropriate scopes configured (already handled in the auth setup)

## How It Works

1. **Email Import**: The system fetches new emails from Gmail inbox
2. **AI Categorization**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to categorize emails based on your custom categories
3. **Smart Archiving**: Archives processed emails in Gmail (doesn't delete them)
4. **Database Storage**: Stores emails with AI summaries and categories in Supabase

## Usage

1. Connect your Gmail accounts
2. Create categories with descriptions
3. Click "Process New Emails" to start the AI processing
4. View categorized emails in your dashboard

The system will:
- Only process emails that haven't been processed before
- Archive emails in Gmail after processing
- Provide AI-generated summaries for better email management
- Categorize emails based on your custom categories and their descriptions
